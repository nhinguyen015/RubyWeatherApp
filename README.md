# RubyWeatherApp
by: Joseph Luna, Nhi Nguyen, Ahhad Mukhtar, David Sarkisian

APP DESCRIPTION: 
This program will make a web based interface that will allow a user to 
view the weather in 5 different cities. It also uses weather descriptions 
in order to match pokemon cards to the conditions. (For example, rain = 
squirtle) 

APP INFORMATION: 
To view critical info about program, navigate to 
demo_app->app->views->home

There the backend.rb and index.html.erb files are located. These files are 
the majority of the code that makes our app possible

NOTE: if the temperature values no longer return, it's because Weather API pulls are no longer free for the future requests. Thank you for understanding!
